# LyricsVisualizer

This project aims to develop a lightweight angular-based lyrics visualizer for spotify. In addition to basic aesthetics, the goal is to display active lyrics on the screen, similar to Karaoke. Lyrics time-stamp data is currently being pulled from a free api located at https://api.textyl.co/api/lyrics
